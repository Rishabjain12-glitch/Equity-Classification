# Equity-Classification
Machine learning project for WiDS 5.0 that builds classifiers on fundamental financial ratios (not prices) to predict long-term equity investment decisions, comparing multiple ML models with conventional equity research methods.
# WiDS 5.0 – Equity Classification [web:0]

Machine learning project from WiDS 5.0 that builds classifiers on fundamental financial ratios of equities (rather than stock prices) to predict long‑term investment decisions. [web:0] The focus is on applying and interpreting multiple ML models in a finance context, not short‑term algorithmic trading. [web:0]

## Project Overview [web:0]

- Use fundamental analysis data (financial ratios) as features for equity classification. [web:0]  
- Train and compare multiple models (e.g., Decision Trees, LDA, Neural Networks) with different hyperparameters. [web:0]  
- Interpret model outputs and compare them with conventional equity selection methods. [web:0]

## Objectives [web:0]

- Understand key financial ratios and their role in equity research. [web:0]  
- Learn best practices for training, validating, and comparing ML models on tabular financial data. [web:0]  
- Translate ML predictions into domain‑relevant insights for long‑term investing. [web:0]

## Tech Stack [web:0]

- Python  
- NumPy, pandas, scikit‑learn (and optionally PyTorch/Keras for NNs)  
- Jupyter Notebooks for experiments and analysis  

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository.  
2. Install dependencies from `requirements.txt`.  
3. Open the notebooks in `notebooks/` and run them in order (data prep → modeling → evaluation).  

## Folder Structure (suggested)

- `data/` – Raw and processed financial ratio datasets  
- `notebooks/` – EDA, modeling, and evaluation notebooks  
- `src/` – Reusable data loading, preprocessing, and model scripts  
- `reports/` – Figures, tables, and summary notes

This project is built as part of the WiDS 5.0 program, under the “Equity Classification” track focusing on the intersection of fundamental analysis and applied machine learning. [web:0]
