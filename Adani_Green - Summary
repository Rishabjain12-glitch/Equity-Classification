Adani Green Energy demonstrates exceptional growth and high earnings quality but carries significant leverage risks.

Strengths: The company is a profit machine, with an industry-leading 92.9% EBITDA margin on power supply and a massive 34.6% revenue CAGR over 4 years. Earnings quality is excellent, with operating cash flow covering net profit by 4.18x. Valuation is attractive (PEG < 0.5) given its 71% profit growth.

Risks: Financial risk is elevated due to aggressive expansion. Net Debt/EBITDA of 8.43x and a Current Ratio of 0.60x indicate tight liquidity and high leverage, typical of infrastructure projects. While long-term power purchase agreements (PPAs) provide cash flow visibility, the company remains highly sensitive to interest rates and refinancing needs.

Verdict: Operationally robust and growing fast, but financially stretched. Suitability depends on risk tolerance for high-debt growth models.
